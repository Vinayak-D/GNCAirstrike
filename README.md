On "master" branch there are several files:

model.m > Contains the parameters for the simulation

runfg.bat > Contains the file that connects Simulink to FlightGear

simulink_model > Contains the Simulink model without connection to FlightGear

simulink_model_FG > Contains the Simulink model with connection to FlightGear
